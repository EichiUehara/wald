### 🚀 WALD: RocksDB WAL Log CDC Implementation for Microservices Architecture

If you're adopting a microservices architecture, you'll likely need to implement an Out-of-the-Box pattern or a Change Data Capture (CDC) pattern. While tools like RedHat's Debezium and NewSQL provide implementations for this, there was a lack of clean, low-level CDC implementations specifically targeting RocksDB's WAL logs—especially for key-value stores used as databases for each domain.

So, I decided to create one myself! 🎉

⚠️ **Note:** This project is not even at beta level yet, but there's a strong demand for this kind of tool. I'll be dedicating more time to enhancing it. 

If you're proficient in C++, I'd really appreciate some help! 🙏💻 Let's make this awesome together! 🌟
